# Assisty
ML powered organization tool. In development iOS app with beta-launch planned for Q2 2024. Focus on productivity and helping visually plan day-to-day life as a student (or if you older and working)

## Project Background Info
This project was started by Rohan Patel during COVID-19, ~April 2020 and has been in development using Swift (SwiftUI + UIKit mix), bits of Java, some Ojbective-C, Create-ML and Python. I (Rohan) am a high school junior studying the IB, graduating class of 2025. This has been my passion project, hobby, and main pass time for much of the last few years. Coding, computer science, and more recently AI, have been a subject of my interest since 3rd grade when I picked up coding for the first time at UCode in Los Angeles. Credits to them, this passion sparked. And now this versatile project exists combining local-ML processes with productivity focused structures to provide a complete experience. 

The project in development since 2020, aims for a Q2 Beta Release on TestFlight and depending on bugs/iterations, an App Store launch during Q3 (which hopefully isn't too busy because of uni apps) Can't wait to get this out to the world! Here are a few pics of the project, the design is still being changed slightly, which has been the main focus since I would say May 2023. The rest of the app underwent a few overhauls in 2022 in terms of data structure with Core Data and reference points, but is now solid and just fine tuning performance and productivity algorithms.

Here are a few pics of the Assisty ML running for an instance where the user demands to be reminded of the task. Very similar to Siri and this was the initial use case, a few others have been included: Find Free Time, Contact [...], Get weather, Set up Event, Show tasks under project, Create Project/Task/Idea/Space/other Assisty instances. Comprehensive and always adding new objects to the ML model (created and hosted using Create ML framework)

## Productivity First
The app takes into account efficiency needs and organizes everything in a visually pleasing manner that is easy to navigate with all the tools tucked into the right places. You can organize tasks in many ways and forms, you have inbox ideas which are general things for the future, and specific tasks that can be assigned to a day and time using Assisty's Chrono ML. Easily switch between Tasks and Ideas for maximum ease as your task list changes dynamically.
