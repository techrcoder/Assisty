## Productivity First
The app takes into account efficiency needs and organizes everything in a visually pleasing manner that is easy to navigate with all the tools tucked into the right places. You can organize tasks in many ways and forms, you have inbox ideas which are general things for the future, and specific tasks that can be assigned to a day and time using Assisty's Chrono ML. Easily switch between Tasks and Ideas for maximum ease as your task list changes dynamically.
