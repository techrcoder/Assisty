# Assisty
ML powered organization tool. In development iOS app, beta launched Q2 2024. Public Release for Q2 2025. Focus on productivity and helping visually plan day-to-day life as a student.

Check out the TestFlight Beta! <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/grjyECa8"> Join the Assisty 4 Beta </a>

!!! The current TestFlight build has expired, I will be releasing a new one in January 2025. Email me at rohanpatel123@gmail.com if you have any requests for information on the status of this project. 

## Project Background Info
This project was started after the COVID-19 lockdowns in France. Developed using Swift (SwiftUI + UIKit mix), bits of Java, some Ojbective-C, Create-ML and Python. I am a high school junior studying the IB, graduating class of 2025. This has been my passion project for much of the last few years as a way to explore coding, computer science, and more recently AI. I started coding in 3rd Grade after taking a class at UCode in Los Angeles. This project combines local-ML processes with productivity focused structures to provide a complete experience. 

Targeting Q2 Beta Release on TestFlight and an App Store launch in 2024 (which hopefully isn't too busy because of uni apps) Can't wait to get this out to the world! Here are a few pics of the project, the design is still being changed tweaked. The rest of the App underwent overhauls in 2022 of the data structure with Core Data and reference points. I'm currently fine tuning performance and productivity algorithms.

Here are a few pics of the Assisty ML running for an instance where the user demands to be reminded of the task. While similar to basic Siri, a few others use cases have been custom developed: Find Free Time, Show Tasks under Project, Create Project/Task/Idea/Space/other Assisty instances. Comprehensive model that will continuously be expanded with new objects in the ML model (created and hosted using Create ML framework)

## Productivity First
The App takes into account personal efficiency needs and organizes everything in a visually pleasing manner that is easy to navigate with all the tools tucked into the right places. It can organize tasks in many ways and forms, it has inbox ideas which are general things for the future, and specific tasks that can be assigned to a day and time using Assisty's Chrono ML. The App easily switches between Tasks and Ideas for maximum ease as the task list changes dynamically.

## What's Going on Right Now
Currently, the UI is mostly finished and so are the Assistant features, I am working on refining model performance and introducing new methods to better interpret user actions. This will improve the intuition. I am also ironing out issues and updating frameworks to meet Apple's latest standards, as much of the foundation work was done prior to the latest revisions to SwiftuI and UIKit. 

This process has been unfortunately delayed by at least 6 months due to university applications and the workload of my current highschool diploma (the International Baccaleareate), but it is almost over and I am very excited to get back, finish, and release Assisty, the product of many years of work and learning.
